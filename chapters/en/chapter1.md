- Quiz
<p></p>
You are going on a fishing trip. While buying equipmeent, you receive an information brochure with information about which lake Michigan fish are safe to eat. The source of the pamphlet is the Department of Health and Humans Services, which runs a campaign called "Eat safe fish". This is most likely an example comming from which approach? 
<choice>
<opt correct="true" text="Health Persuasion Approach.">
Yes. While the term health persuasion approach is perhaps a bit narrow, it traditionally grew out of public institutions trying to inform and influence the public. This brochure tries to mainly raise awareness, but in this case this goes hand in hand with an attempt to steer you away from eating potentially contaminated fish.
</opt>
<opt text="Social Marketing.">
Although social marketing and health communication have a lot in common and are not mutually exclusive, social marketing would be more focused on what you can gain or how to make it more fun or easier to catch and eat healthy fish. It also would likely contain more advertising-style elements and perhaps some gadgets. In practice, the two appraoches blend and it can be more of an identity issue which term people use. I prefer to use the term health communication.
</opt>
<opt text="A Behavior Change Intervention.">
An intervention would be much more focused on individuals, for instance, a smoking cessation training or similar approaches. Of course, there are again many grey zones and one could imagine having events or trainings with local fishing clubs as part of a larger "eat safe fish -campaign", but the pamphlet/brochure itself is mostly reflective of a health persuasion/health awareness aproach.

- Quiz
<p></p>
The best campaign objectives are written to be broad and inclusive of an entire field in order to incorporate the largest goal possible.
<choice>
<opt text="True">
Although it is great to set goals high, too broad and unspecific goals are bad as they are difficult to operationalize and measure, thereby creating uncertainty about whether you are moving towards the goal.
</opt>
<opt correct="true" text="False.">
Right, broad goals are often a problem. Goals should be SMART - Specific Measureable Achievable Realistic Timely. Of note, sometimes campaigns can use on the surface (for the public) a broad statement like "make the world a better place" or "cure world hunger", or "win the fight against cancer", but it is important that behind the scenes there is a more focused goal and a detailed plan for how to achieve it.

<exercise id="5" title="Instructions for the course"  type="video">

Congratulations to completing the first chapter. The goal of this chapter was to bring everyone on more or less the same page, providing common ground and cover the minimal basics of the health campaign business. From here on, we will no longer focus on these big-picture topics, but learn very concrete methods that we can use to optimize messages. 
<p></p>
I have two more points:
<p></p> First, please fill out the form below to provide me with some sense of who you are, why you are taking this course, and how I can make this work well for you. Thank you!
<p></p>
Second, I want to give you an outline and a reminder of how this course is intended to work: 
- D2L and this site provide content - you can chose which works better for you. I personally find  this site better designed and easier to stay on top. You can also find readings online. The reference list provide you with a starting point, but you are welcome to read much more and bring it up in class. I highly encourage you to do readings on your own!
- In terms of meetings, we will in some weeks meet online and in others I will mainly post prerecorded content. I will let you know via email if we do not need to meet for discussions! Regardless of official meetings with the whole class, I will always be available during the scheduled class time for check-ins.
- In terms of the points that make up the grade, the detailed breakup is in the syllabus: First, you need to fill out the forms to receive quiz-points, which are the online-equivalent of attendance points. Second, you need to sign up for the campaign of the day and give a presentation. You can prerecord that presentation! Third, we will have an exam at the end of the course. The exam questions will be very similar to the quiz/form/reflection questions that your will complete throughout the course. Lastly, you will work on your own formative research project. Details on this will be provided in the next chapter.
<p></p>
Thank you! I am looking forward to getting to know you better and hearing your feedback !
