Why is planning so important?

• “A goal without a plan is just a wish”

• “If you fail to plan, you are planning to fail”

• “You must plan for success, not hope to get there by chance.”



\

More specific to the campaigning context

• The first phase in designing any campaign is the

planning phase

• Select issues/behaviors to address

• Select audience

• Find out everything you can about

• Why, what, for whom, etc... a certain health issue exists

• This all informs objectives of the campaign

• Many campaigns are not specific enough in what they are

trying to achieve

• Others want to achieve too many things at once

• This phase requires great effort

• Or all else will fail

Planning = Professionalism & Expertise

“Communication is seen as ‘soft’. While

programme development and practice are

seen as requiring expertise and the

thoughtful consideration of best practices,

communication is an ‘anyone can do it if

you have to’ task. It is time to retire this

thinking. Doing communication

strategically requires the same investment

of intellect and study that these other

areas have been accorded.”

Planning steps

• Assess the health issue or problem and identify all the components of a

possible solution (e.g., communication, changes in policy, or services).

• Answer: Is it a communication problem?

• Define your goal & specific objectives.

• Learn about the causes of the issue and who is affected by it

• Identify your target audience and find out what they know

• Explore settings, channels, and activities to reach intended audiences.

• Identify potential partners and develop partnering plans.

• Develop a (theory-based) communication strategy for the target audience

• Draft a plan.
