<exercise id="2" title="Surveys">
This section gives a coarse overview of surveys as a primary tool for formative research. The use of surveys is so widespread that we could cover surveys in an entire course on survey design and analysis, which in fact is often offered. Here, I give only a quick overview, highlighting the main use cases, major players involved, and a touch on a few issues like using existing survey data, sample representatives and answer biases. The next sections, espeically the one on the Hornik-Woolf Method, will also make use of survey methods.

### Quiz
What is a survey? 
<choice>
<opt correct="true" text="A survey is a method of gathering information from a sample of people.">
Traditionally, the goal of surveys is to generalize the results to a larger population.
</opt>
<opt text="Surveys were a social scientific method used mainly before the internet, but are nowadays barely used.">
Although it is true that the internet has provided us with many alternative methods to "listen in" on the public conversation, consumer beliefs, preferences, and whatever else they share on social media, surveys continue to be a key method to gather insight into specific questions, espeically related to health issues.

### Quiz
A Focus Group is a ? 
<choice>
<opt correct="true" text="form of qualitative research consisting of interviews in which a group of people are asked about their perceptions, opinions, beliefs, and attitudes towards a product, service, concept, or advertisement.">
Focus groups first started as a research method in the 1940s at Columbia University while conducting market research concerning radio soap operas. During the Second World War, Robert K. Merton set out to analyze the effectiveness of propaganda with the use of focus groups.[8] Paul Lazarsfeld had also received a government contract to get insight on individuals' responses to war radio propaganda.
</opt>
<opt text="quantitative research method for belief elicitation, akin to a survey, but with people in the same room.">
Focus groups produce qualitative data, i.e. interpretations, statements, or reactions others' ideas that are not readily quantifiable, although they can (and should) be analyzed, grouped, etc. Also, compared to surveys, focus groups are more dynamic and the social interaction between participants can produce phenomena and insights that are less likely to come to the surface with survey methods.
