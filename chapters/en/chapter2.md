The core idea behind Audience Analysis is 
<choice>
<opt correct="true" text="that communication can be optimized by adapting the message to audience.">
Audience analysis involves gathering and interpreting information about the recipients. The goal is to use this information to craft a more effective message and deliver it with higher precision.</opt>
<opt  text="that it let's you find out the weak points (pressure points) of the audience so you can exploit it.">
Since the public health communication situation does not usually take place in a combative setting, knowing a pressure point is of little use. Audience analysis is a broader concept that helps you understand the audience to create a profile of their knowledge, attitudes, habits, whom they are listening to and when. </opt>
</choice>

<choice>
<opt correct="true" text="to create homogenous groups that overlap in terms of relevant characteristics."></opt>
